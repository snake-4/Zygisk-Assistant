## About The Project

Using the **release** build is recommended over the debug build. Only use debug builds if you are going to make a bug report.

### KernelSU & APatch users:
1. Install ZygiskNext.
1. Make sure the unmount setting is enabled for the target app in the KernelSU/APatch Manager.
1. Disable `Enforce DenyList` in ZygiskNext settings if there is one.

### Magisk users:
1. Update your Magisk to 27.0 or newer for better hiding capabilities. (optional)
1. Turn on Zygisk in Magisk settings.
1. Turn off `Enforce DenyList` in Magisk settings.
1. Add the target app to the deny list unless you're using a Magisk fork with a white list instead.
